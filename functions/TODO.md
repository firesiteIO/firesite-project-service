# Firesite Functions: Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines potential improvements and enhancements for the Firesite backend functions.

## High Priority Improvements

### Code Organization & Structure

- [ ] **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling across all routes and services
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all API endpoints
- [ ] **Complete JSDoc Coverage**: Ensure all functions and modules have proper JSDoc comments
- [ ] **Consolidate Test Files**: Organize test files into a more structured testing framework with Jest
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Move all configuration to environment variables with proper validation

### Performance & Scalability

- [ ] **Implement Caching**: Add Redis or Firestore caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: Review and optimize Firestore queries for better performance
- [ ] **Pagination**: Add pagination to all list endpoints to handle large datasets
- [ ] **Background Processing**: Move heavy operations to background functions

### Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation to all API endpoints
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement more granular permissions system
- [ ] **API Key Rotation**: Implement automatic rotation of API keys and secrets
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Add security headers to all HTTP responses
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for sensitive operations

## Medium Priority Improvements

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Webhooks**: Add webhook support for event notifications
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Support bulk create/update/delete operations
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance API endpoints with more sophisticated filtering options
- [ ] **Export/Import**: Add functionality to export and import data
- [ ] **Versioned API**: Implement API versioning for better backward compatibility

### Developer Experience

- [ ] **Local Development**: Improve local development experience with better tooling
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enhance CI/CD pipeline with more comprehensive testing
- [ ] **Development/Production Parity**: Ensure development environment closely matches production
- [ ] **Mock Services**: Create mock services for easier testing and development

## Low Priority Improvements

### Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] **Enhanced Logging**: Implement structured logging with better context
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Add detailed performance monitoring
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health check endpoints
- [ ] **Alerting**: Set up alerting for critical errors and performance issues

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] **Documentation**: Create more comprehensive internal documentation
- [ ] **Code Samples**: Add code samples for common API usage patterns
- [ ] **Client Libraries**: Develop client libraries for common programming languages
- [ ] **Rate Limiting Refinement**: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting strategies

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Refactor Claude Integration**: Improve the Claude AI integration with better abstraction
- [ ] **Consolidate Duplicate Code**: Identify and eliminate code duplication
- [ ] **Update Dependencies**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
- [ ] **Remove Deprecated APIs**: Replace any usage of deprecated Firebase/Google Cloud APIs
- [ ] **Code Splitting**: Split large files into smaller, more manageable modules

## Future Considerations

### Architecture Evolution

- [ ] **Microservices**: Consider splitting into microservices for better scalability
- [ ] **Serverless Architecture**: Evaluate moving more functionality to event-driven serverless functions
- [ ] **GraphQL API**: Consider adding a GraphQL API alongside REST endpoints
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Enhance real-time capabilities with WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database

### Integration Opportunities
