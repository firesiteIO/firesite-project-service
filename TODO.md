## üìù Notes for Next Session

### Context References
- See `/docs/CONTEXT.md` for current position and handoff details
- Check `/docs/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
- Review `/docs/KAIBAN_ANALYSIS_PLAN.md` for extraction strategy

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Check code quality
npm run code-quality

# View recent changes
git log --oneline -10
```

### Remember
- Service-first architecture always
- All AI operations through MCP Max
- Dog-food from Phase 2 onward
- Update CONTEXT.md before ending session
