# Firesite Project Service

**Revolutionary AI-Human Collaborative Project Management**

> Building the infrastructure for human potential - where software becomes a true extension of human capability rather than a constraint upon it.

**Version**: 2.0.0 - Real Infrastructure Integration Complete  
**Status**: KaibanJS Analysis & Service-First Implementation Phase  
**Port**: 5174 (Vite Development Server with WebContainer Support)

## Vision

Firesite Project Service is the foundation of a fundamentally new paradigm in technology. This isn't just another project management tool - it's the first step toward creating systems where AI agents work as true team members alongside humans, with full development capabilities, context awareness, and the ability to make meaningful contributions.

## Core Philosophy

**Service-First Architecture + AI-First Collaboration = Revolutionary Development**

We're building infrastructure that enables:
- **AI as First-Class Team Members**: Claude Code, specialized agents, and hybrid human-AI teams
- **Context Preservation Through MMCO**: Micro Meta Context Objects that evolve with your projects
- **Adaptive Workflows**: Technology that evolves with teams instead of constraining them
- **True Collaboration**: Seamless coordination between human creativity and AI capability

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tier Project Structure
```
Organizations
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects (Website, Marketing, Core Development)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sub-Projects (Components, Testing, Content)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task Boards (Kanban workflows)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Tasks (MMCO-driven context)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Agents (Human/AI/Hybrid teams)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Integrations (GitHub, external systems)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Team Compositions (Mixed human-AI teams)
```

### Intelligent Service Division
- **Project Service** (This App): Project management, UI, team coordination
- **MCP Max Server**: AI orchestration, MMCO evolution, agent coordination
- **Component Library**: firesite-io-slim provides reusable Tailwind "Lego blocks"

## Revolutionary Features

### ðŸ¤– **True AI Team Members**
- **Claude Code Integration**: Full development environment access
- **Specialized Agents**: PM, Dev, QA, Designer, Analyst with role-specific expertise
- **Dynamic Agent Spawning**: Traffic cops, research agents, testing specialists
- **Hybrid Tools**: Human-guided AI through Claude in Cursor and other tools

### ðŸ§  **MMCO (Micro Meta Context Objects)**
Portable, evolving context that travels with every task:

## Inspired By KaibanJS

We're building on the excellent foundation laid by [KaibanJS](https://github.com/kaiban-ai/kaiban-board), extracting their best concepts while creating a superior service-first implementation:

### What We're Adopting (With Full Attribution)
- **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Team-based AI collaboration concepts
- **Tailwind Components**: Visual design and responsive layouts  
- **Workflow Management**: Task coordination and dependency handling
- **Storybook Integration**: Component development methodology

### What We're Building Better
- **Service-First vs React**: Event-driven architecture instead of component state
- **Real AI Integration**: Full MCP Max orchestration vs basic AI calls
- **Dynamic Teams**: Flexible human/AI/hybrid composition vs fixed roles
- **MMCO Context**: Evolving task context vs static configuration
- **Universal Integration**: Multi-system synchronization vs isolated operation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** with npm or yarn
- **StackBlitz WebContainer Support**: Modern browser with COOP/COEP headers
- **Firesite.ai MCP Max Server**: For AI orchestration (optional - graceful offline mode)
- **Firebase Functions**: For real-time features (optional - graceful offline mode)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/firesite-io/firesite-project-service
cd firesite-project-service

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with WebContainer support
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:5174

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

### Firesite Ecosystem Integration
```bash
# Terminal 1: MCP Max Server (AI orchestration)
cd /Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-mcp-max
npm run dev  # Port 3002

# Terminal 2: Firebase Functions (real-time features)
cd /Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-functions
firebase serve --only functions  # Port 5001

# Terminal 3: Project Service (this application)
cd /Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-project-service
npm run dev  # Port 5174
```

## Current Status

### âœ… **Completed Infrastructure**
- **Real Service Integration**: All mock components removed
- **WebContainer Support**: Full StackBlitz integration with COOP/COEP headers
