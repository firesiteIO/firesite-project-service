# Firesite Project Service - Complete Architecture Documentation

## Project Vision & Mission

The Firesite.ai Project Service provides a revolutionary service-first, AI-assisted project and task management that leverages the context-aware AI system of Firesite.ai. The service provides intelligent, AI planned project and task creation and management via Kanban boards that understand your project context and offer AI-powered, multi agentic assistance for task creation, prioritization, and workflow optimization.

**Firesite is building a fundamentally new paradigm in technology** - one that inverts the traditional relationship between humans and software. Our mission is to create systems that adapt to humans, rather than forcing humans to adapt to static technology. This isn't just another productivity tool. This is the foundation for a fundamentally different relationship between humans and technologyâ€”where software becomes a true extension of human potential rather than a constraint upon it.

## Core Architectural Philosophy

### Service-First Architecture
- **Event-driven communication** via GlobalEvents system
- **Decoupled services** that communicate through events  
- **Multi-tier storage** strategy (localStorage, Firebase, GitHub Gists)
- **Clean separation** between UI, services, and core functionality

### Division of Responsibilities

#### Firesite Project Service (This Application)
**Role: Project Management & UI Layer**
```
ðŸ“Š PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects (create, manage, track lifecycle)
â”œâ”€â”€ Tasks (dependencies, status, workflows)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Team Members (humans + AI agents registry)
â”œâ”€â”€ Tool Registry (available MCP servers, APIs, credentials)
â”œâ”€â”€ Assignments (who does what, task delegation)
â”œâ”€â”€ State Tracking (current status of all elements)
â”œâ”€â”€ UI/UX (Tailwind CSS components, user interactions)
â””â”€â”€ Integration Points (GitHub, Jira, Trello, Notion)
```

#### Firesite.ai MCP Max Server (External Dependency)
**Role: AI Orchestration & Intelligence Layer**
```
ðŸ¤– AI ORCHESTRATION RESPONSIBILITIES
â”œâ”€â”€ MMCO (creation, evolution, management, versioning)
â”œâ”€â”€ Permissioning (access control, credential management)
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Communication (ALL Claude interactions)
â”œâ”€â”€ Agentic Transformations (role switching, agent spawning)
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent Assignments (AI task delegation & coordination)
â”œâ”€â”€ Claude Proxy (acts as proxy for ALL AI operations)
â”œâ”€â”€ Docker Orchestration (MCP server container management)
â””â”€â”€ Context Evolution (MMCO transmutation as tasks progress)
```

### Integration Pattern
```
Firesite Project Service â†’ Firesite.ai MCP Max â†’ Claude APIs
         â†“                        â†“                â†“
    "Task X created"         "Execute with        Response back
    "Team Y assigned"         MMCO context"       to Project
    "Tool Z required"         + Permissions"      Service
```

## Multi-Tier Project Structure

### Hierarchical Organization
```
Organization Level
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects (Website, Marketing, Core Code, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sub-Projects (Components, Testing, Content Creation)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task Boards (Kanban-style workflow management)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Tasks (Individual work items with MMCO context)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dynamic Subtasking (AI created sub tasks when necessary)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Agents (Dynamic assignment: human, AI, hybrid)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Integration Points (GitHub repos, external systems)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Team Compositions (mixed human/AI teams)
â””â”€â”€ Global Resources (Tools, Credentials, Templates)
```

### Project Types & Flexibility
- **Extensible System**: Supports any project type
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Workflows adapt based on project context
- **Sub-Project Support**: Nested project hierarchies
- **Examples**: Write core application code, create website, build marketing campaign, write blog content, analyze traffic patterns, test and QA work

## MMCO (Micro Meta Context Objects)

### Definition
**MMCO = "Portable and Evolving Context" for Claude** The MMCO is a fluid JSON framework created, managed and "evolved" directly by AI to provide all the context it needs to understand each task, its place in the project hieracrhy, progress, history and to identify to tools and permissions required to move toward completeion.

Each MMCO JSON object carries:
- **Task Information**: What needs to be done, how it relates to project vision
- **Evolution History**: Previous decisions, learned patterns, accumulated knowledge
- **Permissions & Credentials**: Access to tools, MCP servers, APIs
- **Vision Links**: References to project goals, parent contexts
- **Tool Provisioning**: Docker container specifications for MCP servers

### Example MMCO Structure
```json
{
  "mmco": {
    "task": {
      "id": "FPS-001",

}
```

### MMCO Evolution Strategy
- **Auto-evolve** as tasks progress
- **Maintain version history** within the MMCO
- **Rely on GitHub branch management** for code rollbacks
- **Handled entirely by MCP Max server**

## Team Architecture

### Expanded "Teams" Concept (Inspired by KaibanJS)
```
Team Composition Structure:
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Members
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Claude.ai (chat interface)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Claude Code (development environment)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Claude Code SDK (programmatic integration)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Specialized Agents (PM, Dev, QA, Designer, Analyst)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Role-specific prompting for each agent type
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dynamic Agent Spawning (traffic cops, research, testing)
â”œâ”€â”€ Human Members
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Direct team members (developers, designers, PM)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hybrid Tools (Claude in Cursor for human-guided coding)
â”œâ”€â”€ External Integrations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Third-party APIs (Jira, Trello, Notion)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Development Tools (GitHub, Firebase, StackBlitz)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Specialized MCP servers (spun up in Docker as needed)
â””â”€â”€ Resource Management
    â”œâ”€â”€ 50 Claude requests per 5 hours (shared between agents + humans)
    â””â”€â”€ Intelligent request prioritization and queuing
```

### Base Agent Types (From KaibanJS Pattern)
1. **Project Manager Agent**: Task coordination, timeline management
2. **Developer Agent**: Code implementation, architecture decisions  
3. **QA Agent**: Testing, quality assurance, bug detection
4. **Designer Agent**: UI/UX design, component creation
5. **Analyst Agent**: Data analysis, performance monitoring

### Team Orchestration & Conflict Resolution
- **Task Decomposition**: Break tasks into non-conflicting subtasks
- **Checkout System**: Exclusive access to code sections during work
- **Recombination Logic**: Merge subtask results when complete
- **Traffic Cop Agents**: Manage workflow conflicts and priorities

## Technology Stack
