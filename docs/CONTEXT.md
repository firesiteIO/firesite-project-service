# Rolling Context Document - Firesite Project Service

> This is a living document that evolves with every session, providing seamless context handoff between Claude instances.

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-13 by Claude Code
**Current Phase**: KaibanJS Analysis & Service-First Implementation
**Session Count**: 2

## üéØ Current Mission

**Immediate Goal**: Analyze KaibanJS codebase and extract patterns for service-first implementation
**Context**: Building revolutionary AI-human collaborative project management system

## üìç Current Position

### What We Just Completed
- ‚úÖ Removed all mock/fake components from the codebase
- ‚úÖ Integrated real infrastructure (Firebase, MCP Max, WebContainers)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation (PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md, KAIBAN_ANALYSIS_PLAN.md)
- ‚úÖ Updated README.md with complete vision and status
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up old documentation files

### What We Just Completed
- ‚úÖ Completed comprehensive KaibanJS core analysis (agent patterns, team orchestration)
- ‚úÖ Finished KaibanJS UI component analysis (Tailwind patterns, responsive design)
- ‚úÖ Created complete extraction report with service contracts and implementation plan
- ‚úÖ Documented technical specifications for service-first vanilla JS implementation

### What We're Working On Now
- üîÑ Finalizing service-first implementation strategy
- üîÑ Preparing for core service development phase
- üîÑ Ready to begin building the actual implementation

### Next Immediate Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Complete**: KaibanJS analysis and extraction report
2. Begin implementing core event system enhancements
3. Build AgentService and TaskService foundations
4. Create base component architecture with Tailwind patterns

## üß† Key Decisions & Learnings

### Architectural Decisions
- **Service-First Only**: All AI operations proxy through MCP Max (we don't handle AI logic)
- **MMCO Evolution**: Auto-evolve with version history, no complex rollback needed
- **Team Orchestration**: Task decomposition + checkout system for conflict resolution
- **Infrastructure Split**: Project Service handles PM, MCP Max handles AI orchestration

### Technical Discoveries
- KaibanJS is React-based, we're building vanilla JS (user hates React)
- Must translate React patterns to event-driven architecture
- WebContainer support is working perfectly with COOP/COEP headers
- Offline mode gracefully handles missing services

### User Preferences
- Hates React (building vanilla JS instead)
- Prefers StackBlitz WebContainers ($60/month subscription)
- Wants full attribution to KaibanJS team
- Dog-fooding is critical (Phase 2 onwards)

## üîó Critical Resources

### Codebase Locations
- **Main Project**: `/Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-project-service`
- **MCP Max Server**: `/Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-mcp-max` (Port 3002)
- **Chat Service**: `/Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-chat-service` (Port 5173)
- **KaibanJS Fork**: `/Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-ai-kanban`
- **Board UI Fork**: `/Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-kaiban-board`
- **Component Library**: `/Users/thomasbutler/Documents/Firesite/firesite-io-slim`
- **Firebase Functions**: Port 5001 (when running)

### Multi-Project Integration Notes
**CRITICAL**: This is NOT a standalone project - expect frequent toggling between:
1. **Project Service** (UI, project management, task coordination)
2. **MCP Max** (AI proxy, MMCO evolution, Docker orchestration) 
3. **Chat Service** (embedded UI components, real-time communication)

**Current Session Scope**: Project Service only (KaibanJS analysis phase)
**Future Sessions Will Require**: Multi-project coordination for MMCO implementation

### Live References
- **KaibanJS Demo**: https://www.kaibanjs.com/#kaiban-board
- **Documentation**: See PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md for complete system design

### Integration Points
- Firebase Functions API: `/api/tasks`, `/api/projects`, `/api/claude`
- MCP Max API: `/api/sessions`, `/api/execute`, `/api/context`
- WebContainer: Full support enabled in Vite config

## üöÄ Active Development Threads

### Thread 1: KaibanJS Analysis
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Goal**: Extract patterns without copying React
**Approach**: Study ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Translate ‚Üí Implement
**Deliverables**: 
- KAIBAN_AGENT_ANALYSIS.md (core patterns)
- KAIBAN_UI_ANALYSIS.md (Tailwind & component patterns)
- KAIBAN_EXTRACTION_REPORT.md (complete implementation plan)

### Thread 2: Multi-Tier Structure
**Status**: Designed, not implemented
**Goal**: Organizations ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Sub-Projects ‚Üí Boards ‚Üí Tasks
**Blocker**: Need KaibanJS analysis complete first

### Thread 3: MMCO Integration
**Status**: Designed, not implemented
**Goal**: Portable context that evolves with tasks
**Note**: MCP Max handles all MMCO operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Constraints

### Current Limitations
- Firebase Functions offline (connection refused) - graceful degradation working
- MCP Max offline (404 errors) - graceful degradation working
- No React in this project (must translate all KaibanJS patterns)

### Resource Constraints
- 50 Claude requests per 5 hours (shared between agents + humans)
- Must balance automated agent work with human interaction needs

## üí° Ideas for Next Session

### If Continuing Current Work
1. Complete KaibanJS pattern extraction
2. Create service contracts for agent operations
3. Design event flows for multi-agent coordination
4. Start implementing team management structure

### If Starting Fresh Thread
1. Review this context document first
2. Check TODO.md for current task status
3. Read any new commits or changes
4. Continue from "Next Immediate Steps" above

## üîÑ Context Evolution

### Session 1 Summary
- Initial setup, discovered React in KaibanJS
- Built fake demo (wrong approach)
- User clarified: remove fakes, build real infrastructure

### Session 2 Summary (Current)
- Removed all fake components
- Integrated real services with offline fallbacks
- Documented complete architecture
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Full KaibanJS analysis phase
- ‚úÖ **DELIVERED**: Complete extraction report with service contracts
- üéØ **READY**: Begin service-first implementation

### Patterns Observed
- User values clear communication about technical challenges
- Dog-fooding is essential (use what we build)
- Service-first architecture is non-negotiable
- Real infrastructure > mock demos

## üåø Git Status

**Current Branch**: main
**Last Commit**: [to be determined at session start]
**Status**: [to be determined at session start]

### Branch History
- **Previous Branch**: main - [initial setup and real infrastructure integration]
- **Current Work**: main - [needs new branch for KaibanJS analysis]
- **Next Branch**: feature/kaiban-analysis-2025-07-13-[time] - [will be created this session]

## ü§ù Handoff Protocol

**For Next Claude Instance**:
1. **Run Auto-Branching Protocol**: Check git status and create new branch if needed
2. Start by reading this CONTEXT.md
3. Check TODO.md for task status
4. Review recent commits with `git log --oneline -10`
5. Look for any new instructions in CLAUDE.md
6. Continue from "Current Position" section above
7. **End Session Protocol**: Auto-commit and push work with context-aware messages

**Remember**: 
- We're building infrastructure for human potential
- Service-first architecture always
- All AI operations go through MCP Max
- Dog-food everything from Phase 2 onward
- Git discipline is automated - just follow the protocol
